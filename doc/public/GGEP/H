The 'H' GGEP Extension
======================

Name: H
Where: Query, Query Hit
Status: Experimental
Date: Sun Jun  9 12:09:17 MEST 2002
Format: <hash type> <binary hash digest>
COBS-Encoding: Maybe
Deflate: Never

The 'H' extension carries a hash digest in binary form.  It is meant to
replace the "urn:xxx:<base32 digest>" representation defined by HUGE in
order to save bandwidth and prevent needless conversions from the base32
form into the binary form.

In Query Hits, it appears after each filename, in place of the "urn:sha1:"
indication.

For backward compatibility reasons, it will not be sent in Queries (despite
the gain it would bring) until major servents support it.  This is to preserve
the ability of gtk-gnutella users to perform queries by hash: the HUGE
representation will be used in the interim.

The payload format is:

    <hash type>  1 byte
    <binary hash digest> x bytes, determined by hash type

The currently supported hash types are:

    0x01    sha1        x=20
    0x02    bitprint    x=20+24=44 (a)

The whole payload can be COBS-encoded in the case where the hash digest
contains NUL bytes and the GGEP extension is used in Query Hits.  It does
not need any COBS-encoding when used in a Query.

The payload is never deflated.

Footnotes
---------

(a)
    The "bitprint" URN was defined in HUGE by

        urn:bitprint:[32-character-SHA1].[39-character-TigerTree]

   Here, we encode it as 20 bytes (binary SHA1) and 24 bytes (binary Tiger)
   without any separator between them.  The first 20 bytes refer to the SHA1,
   the trailing 24 bytes refer to the Tiger tree hash.
