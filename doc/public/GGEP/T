The 'T' GGEP Extension
======================

Name: T
Where: Query Hit (per File Entry)
Status: Experimental
Date: Mon Jul 16 13:58:16 MEST 2003
Format: Plain text
COBS-Encoding: Never
Deflate: Maybe
Revision: $Id$

The "T" extension is used to transport text that can be displayed as-is
by servents, along each entry in the query hit.  It is pure text, without
any embedded NUL byte (and no trailing one), so no COBS-encoding is necessary.

This extension was created in order to deprecate the GEM extension mechanism
outlined in HUGE in favor of the new GGEP model.
