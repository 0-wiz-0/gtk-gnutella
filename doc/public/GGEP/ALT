The 'ALT' GGEP Extension
========================

Name: ALT
Where: Query Hit (per File Entry)
Status: Experimental
Date: Mon Jul 14 20:05:36 MEST 2003
Format: Array of <ip> <port>
COBS-Encoding: Maybe
Deflate: Maybe

[Those specs written by Raphael Manfredi after a proposal from BearShare]

The "ALT" extension is used to carry alternate locations on a file entry
basis.  It is used only for servers that can understand
"/uri-res/N2R?urn:sha1:" requests, and for files that have a known SHA1,
so that the servent may construct the URLs manually.

The payload is an array of 6-byte entries.  The first 4 bytes encode
the IP of the server (in little-endian, watch out!), and the remaining
2 bytes encode the port (in little-endian).

There is no size indication for the array.  The length of the payload
must be a multiple of 6 bytes (after COBS decoding, or course).
