SHORT GUIDE ABOUT TRANSLATING MESSAGES
$Id$

1. INTRO
========

This is a short summary of the gettext documentation. See the
APPENDIX if this information isn't sufficient for you.


2. Extract the translatable strings from the source files:
==========================================================

Update your source files to the latest version from CVS.

Then extract the strings:

 $ cd po
 $ make update-po
 $ cp gtk-gnutella.pot messages.po

If you look at the source files, you'll find many strings which are not marked
as translatable. The reason for this is that these strings are only used
internally or they are only interesting for developers i.e., for debugging.


3. Prepare the PO file:
=======================

Use your favourite editor and edit the first lines of 
``messages.po'' to match these:

"Project-Id-Version: gtk-gnutella VERSION\n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2003-04-15 23:20+0200\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"
"Last-Translator: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>\n"
"Language-Team: LANGUAGE <LL@li.org>\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

Replace VERSION, YEAR, MO etc. with reasonable values. It's important
that you use ``charset=UTF-8'' as above. If your editor doesn't
support UTF-8 don't mind, you can convert that later.


4. Translate the messages:
==========================

You can use a text editor or a graphical PO file editor like "poEdit" for
editing the translations (includes UTF-8 support), see
http://poedit.sourceforge.net.

In the PO file you'll find something like this:

#: main.c:42
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr ""

If you want to translate to German, you would change the 3rd line
to the following:

msgstr "Hallo Welt"

Don't touch the string behind ``msgid''! If you find typos or
the like, this string must be corrected in the source file.
If you see a string with a ``%'' in it, then leave the part with
``%'' as-is and don't change the order of these ``words''.
Also keep the character after an backslash ``\'' as-is.
For example:

msgid "%-8s are %d time faster than %s.\n"
msgstr "%-8s sind %d mal schneller als %s.\n"

See man printf(3) for details about the syntax, if you have
problems with it.

You don't have to translate every message. If you cannot or don't
want to translate a message just leave ``msgstr ""'' as-is. Don't
copy the string of msgid!

There are sometimes strings that are not meant to be translated
(e.g., "window14" or the like) but appear in the PO file nonetheless.
This is caused by glade which tags all strings translatable. Also
as a rule of thumb, strings that contain underscores are usually
used as internal place holders.

4.1 Translation Context:
========================

The GUI often uses single words or short word combinations. When
used as a frame title a colon is appended the English to disambiguate
its meaning. Another possibility to disambiguate especially short
strings is using the character '|' as separator. If the English text
contains this character, the part up to the '|' may contain a comment
for translator and/or simply declare a namespace so that the word can
be translated in a certain meaning even if the same word is used with
different meanings in other places. For example:

	msgid "Bitzi File Judgement|Complete"
	msgstr "Komplett"

In the translated string discard everything up to the first '|' and
translate the rest only.
 
 
5. Convert the output to UTF-8 (if it's not already UTF-8 encoded):
===================================================================

iconv -f CHARSET -t UTF-8 messages.po > utf8.po

Replace CHARSET by the one you use e.g., if your from Western Europe
it's probably ISO-8859-1. Otherwise see what echo $LC_CTYPE says,
and strip the part up to the . (dot). For example:

 $ echo $LC_CTYPE
 ja_JP.eucJP
 $ iconv -f eucJP -t UTF-8 messages.po > utf8.po

If you use Vim you can also convert lines on the fly like this:

:,!iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8

This usually works even if your terminal doesn't support UTF-8
encoded character sets.

6. Install the PO file:
=======================

First, verify that your PO file is correct:

 $ msgfmt --check --strict utf8.po -o output.mo

You should get no warnings but find a file ``output.mo'' which is
binary version of the ``utf8.po'' which will be installed by the
application during its installation.
 
Copy utf8.po with the appropriate name into the po directory:

The part before ``.po'' is simply the country code (ISO 3166). For
example, if you are from the Netherlands:

 $ cp utf8.po ../po/nl.po


7. Stay tuned!
==============

The messages may be changed from release to release and with growing
functionality there will be more messages that should be translated.
Thus, translation isn't something static. Every few month there will
be a few more sentences to be translated.

To update the PO files to reflect any changes to translatable strings
in the source files simply update your files from CVS and run

 $ cd po
 $ make update-po

This will scan the source files for translatable strings, will (re-)build
the file "gtk-gnutella.pot" and will use msgmerge to update the PO files
from the POT file.

After that you can check your language's PO file for missing/fuzzy
translations and add/correct them with you favorite editor.

When you're finished, you should run "make update-po" again. This will wrap
your .po file's lines properly to have a maximum line width of 80 characters.


8. Add localised keys to gtk-gnutella.desktop:
==============================================

The Name, GenericName, and Comment keys should be translated. The 
format is:

Key[locale]=localestring

For example:

Name[nl]=Gtk-Gnutella

Make sure the file stays UTF-8 encoded.
