Quick Release Guide
====================

[The whole process will take ~1 hour]

0. Make sure everything is up to date, since we're releasing based on
   local files:

	cd "top directory"
	cvs update -Pd

1. Write user summary of changes since last release in ChangeLog.

2. Mark toplevel entry in ChangeLog as being the release:

   # v 0.91   2002.10.19  [stable]

   Highlight of changes (user-visible):

   - Change #1.
   - Change #2...

3. Edit src/common.h and setup for the release:

   #define GTA_REVISION "stable"
   #define GTA_REVCHAR ""
   #define GTA_RELEASE "19/10/2002"

4. Commit ChangeLog and src/common.h with comment:

	"Release 0.91 stable."

5. Update and commit debian/changelog.

6. NOTHING.

7. NOTHING.

8. Tag whole CVS:

	cd "top directory"
	cvs tag V-0-91

9. Make a clean distribution package:

	cd "top directory"
	makedist -q -c gtk-gnutella-0.92.1

   This will generate a directory gtk-gnutella-0.92.1

10. Create the tar.bz2

	tar cvf gtk-gnutella-0.92.1.tar gtk-gnutella-0.92.1
	bzip2 -v9 gtk-gnutella-0.92.1.tar

11. Move into the directory.

	cd gtk-gnutella-0.92.1

12. Build the debian package:

	fakeroot debian/rules binary

	This will generate file ../gtk-gnutella_0.92.1-0_i386.deb

13. Convert the file to an RPM package, keeping the same version number:

	cd ..
	fakeroot alien --to-rpm --keep-version gtk-gnutella_0.91.0-0_i386.deb

	This will generate file gtk-gnutella-0.91.0-0.i386.rpm

14. Upload the files to sourceforge.

	ftp upload.sf.net
	ftp> cd incoming
	ftp> binary
	ftp> passive
	ftp> put gtk-gnutella-0.91.tar.gz
	ftp> put gtk-gnutella_0.91.0-0_i386.deb
	ftp> put gtk-gnutella-0.91.0-0.i386.rpm
	ftp> quit

15. Login to www.sf.net and go to the Admin section of the gtk-gnutella
    project.

16. Go to "File Releases"

17. Go to "Add Release" in package gtk-gnutella and create a release "0.91".

18. Paste the ChangeLog high-level summary, and tick "preserve my
    pre-formatted text", then click "Submit/Refresh".

19. Select the 3 files we uploaded earlier and press "Add files".

20. For each file, set the proper processor release type and file type,
    being sure to "Update/Refresh" each change separately.

	(source is "platform independent"/"Source.gz" and the others are
	"i386"/".deb" and "i386"/".rpm".

21. Once all is set, click on "I'm sure" and "Send notice".

22. Go back to the Admin section, "Edit/Add Releases" section.

23. Choose "Edit Release" of "gtk-gnutella".

24. Choose the previous release number and click on "Edit release".

25. Change status to "Hidden" and "Submit/Refresh".

26. Go back to the home page of the project and click on "View ALL project
    files".  Make sure only the latest release is available.

27. Update sourceforge's website: Create a news entry in htdocs/files/en using 
    news_template as a guide and submit it.

28. Change the VERSION file in htdocs/files to update the version number.

	VERSION=0.91

29. Manually update the web site by logging in to gtk-gnutella.sf.net via SSH.

	ssh -l rmanfredi gtk-gnutella.sf.net
	$ cd /home/groups/g/gt/gtk-gnutella
