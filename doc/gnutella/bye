1. Introduction

This proposal is about a new Bye packet that would be sent by servents
upon disconnecting from a connected node, giving a final reason that
the remote end can display.

It is safe to retrofit the Bye packet into the 0.4 protocol.  Indeed, the
packet is the last thing that will be sent by a disconnecting servent, and
it will be otherwise ignored as a bad packet by older servents, which is
not dramatic given it is the last thing they will see on that connection.

This packet is believed to be useful to the developers of Gnutella
servents.  Users will be able to report the error, and maybe understand
what is going wrong, with them or with the remote node.

This packet is also considered by the tenant of that proposal as carrying
some "social value".  Friends say good-bye to each other when they part,
and the Gnutella Network is some kind of modern electronic friendship,
where people gather and friendly share and exchange files, to the mutual
benefit of all parties.


2. The Bye (0x02) Packet

The payload descriptor is 0x02, and the payload content is:

        +------+-----------------------+
        | Code | NUL-terminated String |
        +------+-----------------------+

where Code is a 2-byte error code, encoded in little endian, as usual on
Gnutella.  The remaining is a NUL-terminated String, giving a description
of the error.

The presence of the Code allows for automated processing of the message,
and the regular SMTP classification of error code ranges should apply.
Of particular interests are the 200..299, 400..499 and 500..599 ranges.
Here is the general classification ("User" here refers to the remote
node that we are disconnecting from):

    2xx     The User did nothing wrong, but the servent chose to close
            the connection: it is either exiting normally (200), or
            the local manager of the servent requested an explicit
            close of the connection (201).

    4xx     The User did something wrong, as far as the servent is concerned.
            It can send packets deemed too big (400), too many duplicate
            messages (401), relay improper queries (402), relay messages
            deemed excessively long-lived [hop+TTL > max] (403), send too
            many unknown messages (404), the node reached its inactivity
            timeout (405), it failed to reply to a ping with TTL=1 (406),
            or it is not sharing enough (407).

    5xx     The servent noticed an error, but it is an "internal" one.
            It can be an I/O error or other bad error (500), a protocol
            desynchronization (501), the send queue became full (502).

The format of the String is the following (<cr> refers to "\r" and <lf>
to "\n"):

    Error message, as descriptive as possible

or optionally, something more qualified, with HTTP-like headers giving
out more information:

    Error message, as descriptive as possible<cr><lf>
    Server: some server/version<cr><lf>
    X-Gnutella-XXX: some specific gnutella header<cr><lf>
        for instance telling the host about alternate<cr><lf>
        nodes it could connect to<cr><lf>
    <cr><lf>

The presence of a <cr><lf> at the end of message indicates that HTTP-like
headers are present.  The absence of any <cr><lf> indicates that the
short error message form was used.

Unless circumstances making that impossible (urgent disconnection due
to a memory fault), the HTTP-like headers version should be used, with
at least a Server: header, allowing better tracing and debugging.


3. Sending a Bye (0x02) Packet

Servents should send a Bye packet to a node as the last thing on the
network, and then close the connection.  TCP/IP will make its best to
relay the final data to the other end, even though the local connection
appears closed.  The data may not be able to make it though, but at
least the servent tried.

A Bye packet must be sent with TTL=1 (to avoid accidental propagation by
an unaware servent), and hop=0 (of course!).


4. Reception of a Bye (0x02) Packet

A Bye packet should have hop=0, TTL=1 upon reception, or it should be
immediately discarded as being incorrect.

Upon reading a a Bye packet, a node should immediately close the
connection and stop processing of any other received packet from that
connection that was still pending processing.

A Bye packet should not be sent back on the connection before closing,
since the remote party already initiated the farewell.


5. Write Errors

When a servent is unable to write to an another node (TCP/IP reports the
connection was closed, or the send buffer is full because the node does
not read quickly enough), it should perform additional checking:

* If the connection is reported closed, the servent should begin reading
  from the connection, as TCP/IP buffers the pending input and will
  deliver all the bytes sent by the remote party before closing and
  received by the local host.  The servent should skip all the packets
  and look for a Bye (0x02) packet.  If it finds it, it should display/log
  the error.  Otherwise, it will report a disconnection as usual.

* If the sending buffer is full, the servent should remove all pending
  messages, leaving only the only message that could possibly be
  partially sent, and which needs to be flush in whole to avoid
  protocol desynchronization.  Then, it should enqueue a Bye packet,
  with error code 502, and attempt the delivery of that information for
  some reasonable time.  In any case, no further data should be enqueued
  for this node.  The servent still needs to read the incoming data to
  avoid filling of its own transmit queue at the other end, but discard
  all read data immediately.  This includes any partially received packet
  that we got before discovery of the "send queue full" condition.


6. Examples

Here are examples of Bye packet payloads.  I am showing the error code
in ASCII, but keep in mind it is encoded in the leading two bytes of
the payload, and should not be repeated in ASCII in the message String.
This is simply done here for reading convenience.

    200 Shutting Down<cr><lf>
    Server: my server/version<cr><lf>
    <cr><lf>

    502 Send Queue Full (40960 bytes)<cr><lf>
    Server: my server/version<cr><lf>
    <cr><lf>

    401 Too Many Duplicates (Got 12 packets, 1.4% of your traffic)<cr><lf>
    Server: my server/version<cr><lf>
    <cr><lf>


7. Conclusion

Because the Bye (0x02) packet is the last one sent, it is fully compatible
with the 0.4 protocol.  Servents could begin sending it this very minute,
nothing would break in the Gnutella Network.

Due to this very desirable property, it is hoped that the Bye (0x02)
packet will be retrofitted into the protocol document for version 0.4.

Finally, due to its simple format and its nice social nature, it is
expected to be widespread quite quickly.  Expect to get more informative
disconnection messages anytime soon.

A. Appendix 1: Handshaking Headers

This proposal was initially made for the 0.4 protocol, but with 0.6 comes
the ability for servents to exchange about supported features.

There is no real need to declare any support for the Bye packet, since
by construction this packet will be the last one in the stream.  However,
doing so provides implicit information to the remote node:

    If a servent declaring support for the Bye packet does not send one
    before the connection is broken, one can be fairly certain that the
    connection was closed unexpectedly (e.g. the process was killed).

This specification of the Bye packet therefore requires servents to emit
the following header during handshaking:

    Bye-Packet: 0.1

This advertising for Bye also allows possible extension of those
specifications.  Further versions will be backward compatible, so the
lowest version number should be retained when negotiating.  Even if the
remote end advertises version 0.2, emitting support indication for 0.1
will force the peer to limit itself to the 0.1 specifications.
