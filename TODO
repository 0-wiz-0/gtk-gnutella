RAM's TODO list:

* URL-decode incoming URLs (%20 -> space, etc...)
* Avoid kick on send queue limit: flow control, drop packets.
* Separate drop-in / drop-out stats then.
* Add reverse engineering notes.
* Show node's in/out bandwidth (Exp. Moving Average)
* Implement the Bye packet.
* Implement modular HTTP parsing code as coroutine.
* Add a regression test suite for the protocol.
* Add "safer" resume: read a few bytes we already got, and compare.

TODO List :

- Test and fix the CVS (always needed)

- Add many more configuration possibilities through the GUI (we really needs
  dialog boxes)

- In the future, a section with graphs of traffic (outgoing, incoming, packets...)
  should be a great thing to have.

All other ideas are welcome :)
