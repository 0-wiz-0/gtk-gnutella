This documents describes briefly the things we want to have in gtk-gnutella 

0.94 (1.0)
	* Tigertree 						(JA: started)
	* Smaller memory footprint by using sqlite for:
	 - PARQ
	 - Host cache
	* Faster connecting to the gnutella network by connecting to good /
	  stable ultrapeers first.
	* High outdegree support
	* Inter-up QRP
	* Dynamic query
	* Browse host support
	* Implementation of Horizon Estimation (HEP 0.2)	(TS: started)
	* Meta data
	* magnet links
	* Download proxy
	* GUI: Add / remove of gwebcaches
	* PARQ: Update to 1.1 (to be specified)
	* PARQ: PFS aware
	* PARQ: Tigertree aware
	* PARQ: 'Rotating' queue by filename
	* IP / hostname White list
	* Area-specific logging.
	* Keep track of long uptime ultrapeers
	  - Add parsing of GGEP extension to help finding these

After this release we should start with the gui <-> core/lib seperation.
Therefore 0.94.x will probably be renamed to 1.0 as soon as it is completly
stable
