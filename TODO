TODO List :

- Add many more configuration possibilities through the GUI (we really needs
  dialog boxes)

- It should be possible to specify a forced local ip in the config section

- Of course, allow uploads and sharing of our own files should become a priority...

- In the future, a section with graphs of traffic (outgoing, incoming, packets...)
  should be a great thing to have.

All other ideas are welcome :)
