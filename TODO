This documents describes briefly the things we want to have in gtk-gnutella 

0.94
	* Tigertree support 					(JA: started)
	* HTTP chunked / unknown filesize support		(JA: open)
	* Smaller memory footprint by using sqlite for:
	  - PARQ
	  - Host cache
	* Faster connecting to the gnutella network by connecting to good /
	  stable ultrapeers first
	* Browse host support
	* Implementation of horizon size estimation (HSEP 0.2)	(TNT: done)
	* Magnet URI support
	* GUI: Add / remove of gwebcaches
	* Keep track of long uptime ultrapeers
	  - Add parsing of GGEP extension to help finding these

0.95:
	* Meta data support
	* High outdegree support
	* Inter-UP QRP support
	* Dynamic query supprt
	* Download proxy support
	* PARQ: Update to 1.1 (to be specified)
	* PARQ: PFS aware
	* PARQ: Tigertree aware
	* PARQ: 'Rotating' queue by filename
	* IP / hostname White list
	* Area-specific logging

After this release we should start with the gui <-> core/lib seperation.
Therefore 0.94.x will probably be renamed to 1.0 as soon as it is completly
stable
