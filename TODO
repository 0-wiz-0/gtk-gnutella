RAM's TODO list:

* Kick node after too many TTL=0 messages (like dups)
* URL-decode incoming URLs
* Avoid kick on send queue limit: flow control, drop packets.
* Separate drop-in / drop-out stats then.
* Add reverse engineering notes.
* Send back pongs at MaxTTL, like query hits.
* Show node's in/out bandwidth (EMA)

TODO List :

- Test and fix the CVS (always needed)

- Add many more configuration possibilities through the GUI (we really needs
  dialog boxes)

- In the future, a section with graphs of traffic (outgoing, incoming, packets...)
  should be a great thing to have.

All other ideas are welcome :)
