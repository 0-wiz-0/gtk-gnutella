Introduction
------------

Gtk-Gnutella is a GUI based Gnutella Client. It's based upon the original
look of Gnutella v0.5.

It's a fully featured Gnutella Client designed to share any type of file
the user wishes to share.

It's a Unix clone, and it needs GTK+ (1.2 or above). Gnome is not needed. It
is currently developed and tested under Linux (Redhat 6). It is known to run
at least on Linux and FreeBSD (on 80x86 machines). It is released under the
GNU Public License (GPL).

Installation
------------

You may need to obtain the latest version of Glade to compile this
without warning messages. See freshmeat.net or other Linux sites for
updates.

See the file "INSTALL" for further information.


Quick Start
-----------

Operation is fairly straight forward. Default values are set for getting
started, unless you are behind a firewall. This section should get you
started quickly.

You should have two directories created to store your files, "downloads"
and "done".

Connect to the Internet, start the program and it will try to contact
"gnutellums.com:6346" and obtain a few hosts to connect to. This is a
service provided by dss.clip2.com, another is
"router.limewire.com:6346".

If you don't get a connection, quit the program and restart it to get a
few more hosts from the server. If you still don't get connected, you
may need to check your Internet connection and DNS (etc/resolv.conf)
list. If your Netscape or Konqueror web browser isn't working, you
got a problem. In normal operations you should be connected within
30 or so seconds.

Click on "Config" in the upper left hand box to get the Configuration
Screen, then select your downloads and done directories. Select the
"done" directory as "Paths to Files" also.

Once you are connected to a few hosts (2 or 3 is good) you can perform
a search. Click on "Search" in the upper left hand box to get the Search
Screen, then type in a keyword or two. Gnutella uses "AND" for keyword
searches, so if you type two words both will have to be in the file name
to get a return. In most situations it takes 60 seconds for search
results to be returned. Be patient! You are searching about 20,000 hosts.

Once you see a file name you like, click on it and press the button at
the bottom "Downloads Selected Files" and the file will be queued for
download. Click on "Downloads" in the upper left hand box to see what's
going on.

In the Config Screen, "Paths to Files" is the shared directory, they
are the files you will share to the network. You should always share
your done directory. When downloaded files are complete, they are
moved to the done directory and then can be uploaded by others. Sharing
is the whole point of this program.

The client is pretty smart and won't "hammer" a host, even if you select
all the files a host has, if the host is busy it will only try that host
every so often. Select as many files as you like.

The default search selection option is "pick all", so when you click
on a file that several other hosts have, it will automatically select
any file in the list that is the same size or larger. This gives you
a better chance of completing a file if a host drops off the
network. Duplicate names are handled in the download manager, so
don't worry about that. It's better to wait a little bit for all the
search results to come in, then click on file names you like.

Once a file is in the "done" directory, unless you pick a larger file,
the download manager will not download that file again.

There are more features, click around and get used to the program. Most
things make sense. Visit Gnutella web sites for more information on
Gnutella, the protocol and network etiquette.


Bug Reports
-----------

This software will always be in a state of development, improvements
being added all the time. Stable version will be posted from time
to time, but your feedback is needed by developers in order to
make a great program!

Please post any Bug Reports to the Bug Manager on the sourceforge
project page.


Developers, Programmers and Other Tech Info
-------------------------------------------

The following information is for Developers only.

* Run multi copies on the same computer:

If you simply do a "make" rather than a "make install" a version
of Gtk-Gnutella will appear in your "src" directory. Create a new
directory called "test1", make a copy of the config file found in
home dir/.gtk-gnutella called "config" and place it into the "test1"
directory.

Place the compiled version of Gtk-Gnutella into that directory,
add a "download" and "done" directory if you like, and from a shell prompt
type "./gtk-gnutella". The program will check for the local config file
first and use it. The hosts file will now be read and saved to the local
directory. If you change the port number in the config file, you can
run as many copies as you want from different directories. You can also
have them connect to each other by using IP 127.0.0.1:6346 (or whatever
port).

If you set the config variable "stop_host_get" the client will
not try to connect to any outside hosts, thus you can manually connect to
your local IP:port of the other client you have running for testing. It
won't timeout the host because of inactivity like it normally would.

* Debug variable use:

A config variable called "dbg" is used to print debug information to
the terminal window. It has 10 levels, the higher the level, the more
information is printed. Don't set it to 10 unless you like to see way
too much information! Data such as raw search packets are shown at level 7.
Small warnings and other stuff is found at level 1 or 2.

* Developer info:

Feel free to sign up and participate in the mail list. To get up to
speed, you might want to read some of the past messages in the archives
and see what we have been up to lately.

Watch out when modifying code that you un-allocate any allocated
memory. The function "strdup()" will allocate memory that needs to be
"free()" in some cases. maloc is used a lot.

When editing the code, please turn off any options in your editor that
replaces tabs with spaces. We use tabs that create 4 spaces in our source
files. And turn off line wrapping!

Some common inline mode settings for editors are:

	/* vi: set ts=4 */

for vi and its relations, and

	/* -*- mode: cc-mode; tab-width:4 ;-*- */

for emacsen and its cousins.

Consider src/header.c and src/header.h good examples of that style.

Please use the patch manager found on the main development page to post
any patches you may have come up with. It allows you to upload the patch
file as a binary. Posting to a email list usually wraps lines and messes
up a patch file. You should let everyone on the mail list know that
you posted a patch to the patch manager.

If you find bugs, please use the bug manager on sourceforge (or fix them!).
Once you get a copy from anon CVS (see the CVS page for instructions),
and you make some modifications, from a shell make sure you cd into the
"gtk-gnutella-current" directory, type "cvs diff -u > output-diff.txt"
and a patch file will be created, referencing the current CVS version.
You can then upload this file so others can patch their version with
your changes. We use the "unified" format for patches, thus the "-u".
If your patch requires other patches, you should include them also.
Before starting a big project, you may want to ask the list if anyone
else is working on that fix so you don't duplicate work.


Original Message from Olrick
----------------------------
(this was the original README message from the original author)

This is gtk-gnutella, a screen-shots-only-made clone of window$ gnutella.

Why 'screen-shots-only' ? because I have ONLY linux installed on my box :)
So I have never used or even seen a working window$ gnutella -
only screenshots...  (screenshots of gnutella version 0.50c)

I have used Glade 0.5.7 to create the interface.

This soft is awfully written, I know... but I spent no more than a few
days on it :)
So if you feel like improving it... there's no problem at all :)

gnutella official "unofficial" web site is at http://gnutella.wego.com/
