This is gtk-gnutella, a screen-shots-only-made clone of window$ gnutella.

Why 'screen-shots-only' ? because I have ONLY linux installed on my box :)
So I have never used or even seen a working window$ gnutella - only screenshots...
(screenshots of gnutella version 0.50c)

I have used Glade 0.5.7 to create the interface.

This soft is awfully written, I know... but I spent no more than a few days on it :) 
So if you feel like improving it... there's no problem at all :)


gnutella official "unofficial" web site is at http://gnutella.wego.com/
