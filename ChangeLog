# since last version

- gtk-gnutella.spec now generated at configure time thanks to a patch
  from Sam Varshavchik
- LimeWire shut down their router.limewire.com pong cache
- Trace IP of HTTP requests/replies we send or receive
- Check for valid index/name combination before checking for upload slots
- Automatically and silently ignore 0-byte files in search results
- Silentlently ignore files located in private IPs if we don't send pushes
  (this is a temporary hack until someone adds a radio button to achieve this)
- Detect changes in indices for files we already found, and update the
  download queue accordingly (patch from Vladimir Klebanov)
- Improved hex dumping routine and use it to dump data on connection problems
- Don't send user/password to proxy if none was configured
- Assume we're firewalled and advertise so until we get an incoming connection
- Try to parse all extended Query Hit Data (the open part) assuming BS compat.
- Started to reorganize GUI/callbacks in search.c, moving relevant code to
  callbacks.c and gui.c.  There is still a fair amount of mixing between the
  GUI stuff and the program logic, requiring further fine tuning.
- Rewrote NUL detection logic in search query, and now dumps yet unhandled
  extra query data
- Constant refactoring: moved download/upload/socket constants and state
  inspection predicates into their respective headers
- Now scan uploads for timeouts, and added configuration of the various
  time limits via two new config variables: "upload_connected_timeout" and
  "upload_connecting_timeout"
- Proxy connection errors were not reported (show_error() was not implemented)
- Now parses HTTP headers correctly
- Handles HTTP "HEAD" requests correctly
- Handles incoming Gnet handshaking at the 0.6 level
  (but does not issue outgoing 0.6 handshakes yet)
- Cancelled uploads are now logged with details, since they don't appear
  in the GUI currently
- Mark upload/download as stalled if no I/O within the last minute
- The amount of seconds between two automatic re-queries of the network
  now has to be at least of 300 seconds
- Fixed memory leak in uploads (found by Nate)
- Connection statistics now show two figures, as "x/y": x is the amount of
  connected sockets, and y is the amount of attempts made in the background
  but not yet fully connected at the application level
- Node connections statistics are dumped for debugging
- Downloads now use the new HTTP header parsing code
- Don't hammer host caches, allow a reasonable delay between two consecutive
  connection attemps to the same host
- Now uses fresh pongs when the saved caught host list has been re-read
- Send 10 fresh pongs to old 0.4 servents to whom we deny the connection
- Sent Pushes now use the Gnet connection socket, so they will work when
  behind a masquerading+forwarding firewall with only the Gnet port opened.

- Was mistakenly using signed integer in GET requests for file indices
- Double check requested file names with those in our library for extra safety
- When download completes, remove all queued entries for same filename
- Results differing only by connection speed are now considered identical
- The payload size of query hits was written in native format, instead of LE!
- Optimized query hit packet construction, reducing mem fragmentation
- Now shows itself as "Gtk-Gnut" instead of "Gtk-Gnutella"
- Fixed important sharing bug where extensions were not matched for correctly
- Can now configure a max size for the host cache (defaults to 20480)
- Kicking policies for dup messages and high TTL now configurable

# v 0.15   2001.09.20

- No longer depends on having "glade" or "tcl" for building
- Try to simultaneously connect to as many hosts as permitted by min settings

- Only resort to host catchers when host catch is empty
- Now uses 4 host catchers: router.limewire.com, connect[1..3].gnutellanet.com
- Fixed improper GUI dependency between min/max node connection settings
- Identify as a "modern" client in the GUID, handling protocol 0.4.
- Allocate node reception buffer once, not each time a >4K message is received.
- Avoid dropping replies on high TTL, adjust the field down
- Send back pongs and query hits using the hop count of request as TTL
  (since replies must be routed along the same path, it need not be greater)
- Kick out nodes sending us messages with TTL=0.
- Initial host catcher is now router.limewire.com.
- Ignore file count and sizes in pongs when high bits are set (obviously wrong!)

- check for non resuming clients
- don't download the same filename twice
- dequeue one download once a second in the main loop
- download_pickup_queued disabled
- move file from completed dir to partial dir when a bigger one with
  the same name is downloaded (both dirs should be on the same drive,
  otherwise the copying will take so long on big files that most
  connections will timeout).
- requeue on timeout
- don't remember that you gone into push mode, try a direct connect
  each time.
- accept long urls on uploads such as a proxy would send

* v 0.12          2000.05.03

- All C++ style comments have been replaced by C style comments
- Incoming connections are now accepted again (lame bug created in 0.11 fixed)
- Slashes are replaced by backslashes in downloaded files names
- Downloaded files are no more created before we actually receive data for them
- Queued downloads can now be reordered by drag and drop
- Queued downloads can now be started at any time (using right mouse button on
  them)
- Active downloads can now be forced to push mode, moved back to the queue,
  or killed (with the output file removed) using right mouse button on them
- Preferences and configuration are now saved in a directory instead of a
  single file. You can choose the path of the directory to be used by setting
  the GTA_GNUTELLA_DIR environment variable before running gtk-gnutella.
  By default it will be ~/.gtk-gnutella/ 
- Estimated TR (Time Remaining) is displayed while downloading files
- Catched hosts are now saved in clear text in a separate file:
  GTA_GNUTELLA_DIR/hosts
- Catched hosts can be imported from and exported to any text file (using
  right mouse button on the gnutella host catcher)
- Gtk-Gnutella should now compile (using gcc) and run on more processors
- A few memory leaks removed, but some remain (I don't know where yet)
- Serious bug that made Gtk-Gnutella send garbage when the sendqueue for slow

- Completed download files are now moved to a different directory, that can be
  choosen in the config screen
- Gtk-Gnutella now remembers the position and the size of the window

  search results list (GTK doesn't seem to handle well auto sorting)


* v 0.11          2000.04.19

- Sizes of files in the gnutellanet stats, in search results and in downloads
  lists are now displayed in B, KB, MB or GB. By the way, the gnutellanet
  stats will display the right number of shared bytes...
- Search results can now be sorted by File name, Size, or Speed.
- Buttons 'abort selected', 'resume selected' and 'clear completed' in the
  download section should be less randomly active / unactive.
- The numbers of active and completed downloads should be more accurate.
- The number of routing errors should be more accurate too.
- Some warnings about malformed packets have been removed (that happens too
  often to be displayed...)
- Do not allow more than one incoming connection from the same IP, to prevent
  connect flood attacks (Somebody tried to establish more than 32 simultaneous
  connections (from the same IP) to my client today...)
- Catched hosts are now saved, and reloaded next time Gtk-Gnutella is started.


* v 0.1           2000.04.16

- First release of Gtk-Gnutella :)
