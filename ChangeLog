# since last version

- Node send queue is now managed as a real queue.
- Added node transmission flow control.
- Routing decisions and actual routing are now two distinct operations.
- Some download control hardwired constants were made config parameters.
- Fixed downloading policy to avoid retrying ad infinitum when the connection
  cannot be made at the TCP/IP level (because there's nothing listening).
- Added support for the Bye packet.
- Dispatched heartbeat timer routines to the relevant files.
- Integrated HTTP proxy patch [From Szabolcs Seláf].
- Properly handle Range requests such as "123-456" and "-567".  Still no
  handling for things like "123-456,457-789" though.
- Extract and log vendor information of nodes we connect to.
- Fixed improper counting of TX-dropped packets in flow-control as RX-dropped.
- All % completion figures now shown with 2 decimals.
- Since we can now automatically determine our IP correctly, make sure the
  "force local IP" parameter is true by default.
- Could be sending pongs with TTL=0 by mistake.
- Was always sending pings with TTL=1 by mistake.
- Initial take at bandwidth management -- can only be configured via the
  config file, i.e. once and for all.  Gnet traffic does not count.
- HTTP error code 408 is retryable.
- Include Date and Last-Modified headers in our HTTP success replies.
- Switched to real-time download/upload transfer rate and ETA computations.
- Fixed number of columns in search table to 5.
- Fixed bug in handling node_bye() for ponging-only connections (#518822).
- When current transfer rates are too low, switch to average rate for
  estimating time remaining.
- More cleanup in the routing code, which fixes a potentially harmful bug.
- Ensure original downloads are saved in downloads.orig, and protect against
  sudden death whilst saving.
- Turn on TCP_CORK for uploads, to optimize outgoing bandwidth.
- Makes use of sendfile(2) if available.

# v 0.80   2002.01.31  [stable]
# v 0.80   2002.01.22  [beta2]

- Fixed I/O memory leaks.
- Fixed filter memory leaks.
- Fixed ping/pong counting memory leaks (in obsolete code anyway).
- At end of download, also remove "Retry in 10s" entries bearing same name.
- Now makes accurate use of the HTTP "Connection:" header.
- Don't try to open local "config" directory as a file.
- Improved the download selection logic on pushes.
- Be sure to reinstall the SIGPIPE signal handler within the handler
- Fixed bug in header parsing when NUL is the first char on the line.
- Stop filling our Query Hit packets when we reach our own max size limit.

# v 0.80   2002.01.19  [beta]

Summary of changes (user-visible):

- Download queue made persistent: your pending downloads will be saved and
  resumed the next time gtk-gnutella is started.
- The download queue will now show the Host information.
- Pushes now work correctly, and gtk-gnutella can also serve push requests to
  others, so people behind firewalls may now share as well.
- Search results filtering has been implemented: until now, there was only
  the GUI part without any real work done.
- Sorting by host now works on search results.
- Supports the 0.6 handshaking protocol, both for incoming and outgoing
  connections.  Still accepts 0.4 incoming requests, or issues 0.4 outgoing if
  the remote node does not appear to support 0.6.
- Ping/pong traffic is now limited to a few hundred bytes per second on each
  connection, lowering the bandwidth usage: you should be able to open more
  connections than before for the same bandwidth used.

Detailed changes:

- gtk-gnutella.spec now generated at configure time. [From: Sam Varshavchik]
- LimeWire shut down their router.limewire.com pong cache.
- Trace IP of HTTP requests/replies we send or receive.
- Check for valid index/name combination before checking for upload slots.
- Automatically and silently ignore 0-byte files in search results.
- Silentlently ignore files located in private IPs if we don't send pushes
  (this is a temporary hack until someone adds a radio button to achieve this).
- Detect changes in indices for files we already found, and update the
  download queue accordingly (patch from Vladimir Klebanov).
- Improved hex dumping routine and use it to dump data on connection problems.
- Don't send user/password to proxy if none was configured
- Assume we're firewalled and advertise so until we get an incoming connection
- Try to parse all extended Query Hit Data (the open part) assuming BS compat.
- Started to reorganize GUI/callbacks in search.c, moving relevant code to
  callbacks.c and gui.c.  There is still a fair amount of mixing between the
  GUI stuff and the program logic, requiring further fine tuning.
- Rewrote NUL detection logic in search query, and now dumps yet unhandled
  extra query data.
- Constant refactoring: moved download/upload/socket constants and state
  inspection predicates into their respective headers.
- Now scan uploads for timeouts, and added configuration of the various
  time limits via two new config variables: "upload_connected_timeout" and
  "upload_connecting_timeout".
- Proxy connection errors were not reported (show_error() was not implemented).
- Now parses HTTP headers correctly.
- Handles HTTP "HEAD" requests correctly.
- Handles Gnet handshaking at the 0.6 level.  All handshakes are now made at
  the 0.6 level, and upon failure, retried at 0.4.  As for incoming
  connections, both 0.4 and 0.6 are supported.
- Cancelled uploads are now logged with details, since they don't appear
  in the GUI currently.
- Mark upload/download as stalled if no I/O within the last minute
- The amount of seconds between two automatic re-queries of the network
  now has to be at least of 300 seconds.
- Fixed memory leak in uploads (found by Nate).
- Connection statistics now show two figures, as "x/y": x is the amount of
  connected sockets, and y is the amount of attempts made in the background
  but not yet fully connected at the application level.
- Node connections statistics are dumped for debugging.
- Downloads now use the new HTTP header parsing code.
- Don't hammer host caches, allow a reasonable delay between two consecutive
  connection attemps to the same host.
- Now uses fresh pongs when the saved caught host list has been re-read.
- Send 10 fresh pongs to old 0.4 servents to whom we deny the connection.
- Sent Pushes now use the Gnet connection socket, so they will work when
  behind a masquerading+forwarding firewall with only the Gnet port opened.
- Fixed a couple of buglets introduced by the late re-organization of code.
- Added handling of push requests sent by remote servents, i.e gtk-gnutella
  will now reply when others request us to push a file to them.
- If search results say remote servent is firewalled, start immediately in
  push mode when downloading, provided pushes are authorized.
- Recognizes more vendor codes in QHD (Query Hit Descriptor).
- Implemented LimeWire's ping/pong reducing scheme.
- Created doc/gnutella directory, populated with reference on the recently
  implemented algorithms.
- Fixed index-updating bug for downloads in push mode: the mapping was
  not updated correctly, resulting in a failed assertion later on.
- Advertise "Pong-Caching: 0.1" in the 0.6 handshake reply.
- Factorized creation of version string, in a "version_string" global
  that is now used everywhere the name of the program and its version needs
  to be output in a header (User-Agent and Server headers).
- Forgot that search reissue timeout of 0 meant "no reissue".  Fixed, and
  adapted the label text in front of the entry textarea.  Also enlarged
  the area a bit.  [From: Nate]
- Fixed IP/port setups for socks4 and socks5 proxies: now use network order
  instead of native. [From: Robert Bihlmeyer]
- Was not validating config variable `min_dup_ratio'.  Adapted its comment,
  and made other cosmetic change to the config file output.
- Now initializes version string once and for all, at main() time.
  This string is then consistently used in all emitted headers.
- Parses remote "Pong-Caching:" hanshaking header.
- During download requests, force push immediately if the remote end's IP:port
  appears to be not connectible, even if the "Push" bit is not set in QHD.
- Created new "Stopped" state, which is used on retry-able error conditions,
  such as EOF or "Connection reset by peer" errors.  The retry timer was
  shortened from 60 to 15 seconds, awaiting to make it configurable.
- Detect and print as such a failed outgoing connection that sent us
  connection pongs nonetheless.
- Fixed improper trailer generation in query hits: the last flag byte was
  not copied at all.
- Suppressed md5 from the source, it's no longer used.
- Refactoring in routing logic, mainly for push packet handling.
- Push packets are now routed correctly, and no longer widely broadcasted.
- Pushed downloads will abort when the route to the remote servent is lost.
- Forgot to detect TTL=0 pings in our new ping/pong handling logic.
- In case the handshaking fails with a remote strange server, read more data
  to be able to trace more of their reply.
- Now parses the Query Hit packets only once, no matter how many searches open.
- Integrated filtering patch [From Robert Bihlmeyer].  You may now apply
  filters to your searches.
- Double-clicking on a file in the search window will request downloading
  of the selected files. [From Noel T.Nunkovich]
- Removed useless and memory hog host catcher list in the gnutellaNet screen:
  saves 2 MB of RAM plus avoids cost of updating it [From Mark Schreiber].
- Be tolerant on servents that do not send a Content-Length but send
  a proper Content-Range line instead (which we tolerantly parse as well).
- Accept searches even though we might not be connected to the net yet
  [From Mark Schreiber].
- Added Host indication in the download screen [From Mark Schreiber].
- Fixed buglet in has_same_active_download() where "waiting" downloads
  were not considered when looking for duplicates, which could lead to
  assertion failures for pushes later on.
- When not sharing, don't return query hits [From Mark Schreiber].
- When not sharing, send them a "410 Sharing currently disabled" error.
- Added X-Live-Since: to all our HTTP replies.
- Added download queue persistence.
- Download resuming now checks for proper file via an overlap of 512 bytes.
- Split hostcache into two distinct lists: the reserve, and the list of
  nodes we tried and are known to be valid Gnutella servers.  In an attempt
  to limit the tendency of the hostcache to remove hosts rapidly.
- Will now automatically determine that the forced local IP is obsolete
  and change it on the fly, provided we're connecting to modern servents,
  which make use of the Remote-IP header during handshaking.
- Compute IP address of public hostcaches once, to avoid many long DNS lookups.
- When low on hosts in cache, collect "semi-pongs" from Query Hits
  (an idea from Mike Green).  The "low" threshold is 12.5% of maximum.
- Added URL escaping routines.
- Now supports URL-escaped requests, but still sends un-escaped requests to
  remote servents.
- Advertise our node address/port using the Node: header on all outgoing
  handshakes.
- Minor reformatting of config file comments, and raising of default max
  messages to be more tolerent on replies, whilst reducing greatly the max
  size of queries to limit potential of abuse.

- Search results can now be sorted by File name, Size, or Speed.
- Buttons 'abort selected', 'resume selected' and 'clear completed' in the
  download section should be less randomly active / unactive.

  often to be displayed...)
- Do not allow more than one incoming connection from the same IP, to prevent
  connect flood attacks (Somebody tried to establish more than 32 simultaneous
  connections (from the same IP) to my client today...)
- Catched hosts are now saved, and reloaded next time Gtk-Gnutella is started.


* v 0.1           2000.04.16

- First release of Gtk-Gnutella :)
