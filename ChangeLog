* v 0.13          2000.05.??

- 32 bits overflow when computing the size of all files on the GnutellaNet
  (in the gnutellanet stats) should been fixed
- Currently implementing the multiple simultaneous searches

* v 0.12          2000.05.03

- All C++ style comments have been replaced by C style comments
- Incoming connections are now accepted again (lame bug created in 0.11 fixed)
- Slashes are replaced by backslashes in downloaded files names
- Downloaded files are no more created before we actually receive data for them
- Queued downloads can now be reordered by drag and drop
- Queued downloads can now be started at any time (using right mouse button on
  them)
- Active downloads can now be forced to push mode, moved back to the queue,
  or killed (with the output file removed) using right mouse button on them
- Preferences and configuration are now saved in a directory instead of a
  single file. You can choose the path of the directory to be used by setting
  the GTA_GNUTELLA_DIR environment variable before running gtk-gnutella.
  By default it will be ~/.gtk-gnutella/ 
- Estimated TR (Time Remaining) is displayed while downloading files
- Catched hosts are now saved in clear text in a separate file:
  GTA_GNUTELLA_DIR/hosts
- Catched hosts can be imported from and exported to any text file (using
  right mouse button on the gnutella host catcher)
- Gtk-Gnutella should now compile (using gcc) and run on more processors
- A few memory leaks removed, but some remain (I don't know where yet)
- Serious bug that made Gtk-Gnutella send garbage when the sendqueue for slow
  nodes excedeed 1024 bytes has been fixed
- Completed download files are now moved to a different directory, that can be
  choosen in the config screen
- Gtk-Gnutella now remembers the position and the size of the window
- Automatic sorting of search results can be stopped by right clicking in the
  search results list (GTK doesn't seem to handle well auto sorting)


* v 0.11          2000.04.19

- Sizes of files in the gnutellanet stats, in search results and in downloads
  lists are now displayed in B, KB, MB or GB. By the way, the gnutellanet
  stats will display the right number of shared bytes...
- Search results can now be sorted by File name, Size, or Speed.
- Buttons 'abort selected', 'resume selected' and 'clear completed' in the
  download section should be less randomly active / unactive.
- The numbers of active and completed downloads should be more accurate.
- The number of routing errors should be more accurate too.
- Some warnings about malformed packets have been removed (that happens too
  often to be displayed...)
- Do not allow more than one incoming connection from the same IP, to prevent
  connect flood attacks (Somebody tried to establish more than 32 simultaneous
  connections (from the same IP) to my client today...)
- Catched hosts are now saved, and reloaded next time Gtk-Gnutella is started.


* v 0.1           2000.04.16

- First release of Gtk-Gnutella :)
